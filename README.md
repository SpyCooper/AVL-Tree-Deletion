# AVL-Tree-Deletion
This was a project for my data structures class in the spring of 2023. The purpose of this project was to understand how AVL trees worked and how to work with them.

A good portion of the code was given to us, however, the code that I wrote were the following:
- AVLNode* getPred(AVLNode* node)
- void remove(AVLNode* &root, int badValue, bool& isShorter)
- void printData(AVLNode* &root)
- void printHeight(AVLNode* &root)
- int checkHeight(AVLNode* &root)

The test cases that were given to us to use to test the program are given in the testcases folder.
